<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>At present, Crowdfunding source of raising funds typically for startups or projects has gained popularity with most startups resorting to the use of Crowdfunding platforms to raise funds in exchange of equity because it is relatively inexpensive and uncomplicated in nature. In the existing model, Pool of people contribute small amounts of money towards a project or cause and expect some financial returns. The call for a solution to issues related to security, investor abuse and, illegal transactions that could plague crowdfunding has lead me to investigate the implications of blockchain in Crowdfunding.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>A global challenge facing start-ups is the raising of the required funds. Although there are many sources of funds available to entrepreneurs who wish to start new businesses or expand existing ones, the challenge of getting inexpensive funding at the right time still remains a challenge in the small business domain. The emergence of crowdfunding as a brainchild of crowd-sourcing provides an alternative form of funding for start-ups.
</li>
<br>
  <li> Collective is an online equity crowdfunding platform managed by smart contracts on Ethereum. The platform enables start-ups and projects to raise funding in return of equity. Individual can invest a relatively small amount of money in-order to receive stake in a company at an early stage hoping to get good returns in the long-term as the startup/project grows. Along with funding, Collective also enables startups/projects to find the required talent for their projects.</li>
<br>
  <li>What makes Collective truly unique is its decentralized and autonomous approach towards crowdfunding using smart contract that are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and a mobile app created using Googleâ€™s Flutter which can be used on both Android and IOS.</li>

This platform exclusive ERC20 token along with smart contracts enables Collective to tackle the issue of trust and security that plagues all the existing crowdfunding platforms.
